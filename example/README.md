# example

The sample basic flutter project that is created when you do a `flutter create example`.

## Getting Started

This project is the starting point for a Flutter application that has been modified for use in this testing
project.

You can run the app with the normal `flutter run`, and then run the tests with the shell script (or manually
entering the same) - `./run.sh` in the example folder.
